An entry for the Ludum Dare 38; Theme: A Small World.

Running
=======
This project is constructed using [Urho3D](https://urho3d.github.io).

It currently uses the Urho3D player to run Lua scripts. A Windows batchfile
called SmallCity.bat has been included to call the Urho3D player to start the
game. For Linux installations, a shell file has been included called SmallCity.sh.

Make sure that the Urho3DPlayer path is correct in this file.
